goose is a general-purpose AI agent that runs on your machine. Not just for code — use it for research, writing, automation, data analysis, or anything you need to get done.

A native desktop app for macOS, Linux, and Windows. A full CLI for terminal workflows. An API to embed it anywhere. Built in Rust for performance and portability.

goose works with 15+ providers — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Ollama, OpenRouter, Azure, Bedrock, and more. Use API keys or your existing Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini subscriptions via [ACP](https://goose-docs.ai/docs/guides/acp-providers). Connect to 70+ extensions via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) open standard.

goose is part of the [Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)](https://aaif.io/) at the Linux Foundation.

## Mancha (BharatGen)

This is the BharatGen white-labelled distribution of goose (Apache-2.0; modified — see the commit history, not affiliated with or endorsed by the goose maintainers). It ships with the Manch LiteLLM gateway preconfigured (`litellm` provider, `bharatgen-param` model) and stores its config in `~/.config/mancha`.

### Install (macOS / Linux)

```bash
clients/install.sh --url https://llm.<your-domain> --key <your-virtual-key>
```

from the `clients/` directory of [mancha-code](https://github.com/Bharatgen-Tech/mancha-code). It installs the CLI and OpenCode, backs up any existing config, and writes your settings to `~/.config/mancha/env`. Virtual keys are issued by admins (`scripts/provision.py key`).

### Use

```bash
source ~/.config/mancha/env     # or add it to your shell profile
goose session                   # interactive session
goose run --text "explain this repo"
```

No provider setup needed: on first use, the `litellm` provider and `bharatgen-param` model are preconfigured — your key and gateway URL come from the installer. Telemetry is off (`GOOSE_TELEMETRY_OFF=1`).

### Local build

```bash
cargo build --release -p goose-cli --bin goose
# binary: target/release/goose
```

Build deps on Linux: `build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libdbus-1-dev libxcb1-dev clang` (libclang is required by bindgen). Desktop app: see `ui/desktop/README.md`.

# Get started
